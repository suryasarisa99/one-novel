### About One Novel

Welcome to One Novel, your ultimate platform for writers to showcase their talent and achieve financial success! We are dedicated to supporting budding and experienced writers through our unique Writer Benefit Programme. Our goal is to empower writers by providing them with opportunities to earn rewards, gain recognition, and build a community of literary enthusiasts.

#### Writer Benefit Programme

The Writer Benefit Programme is designed to help writers achieve their dreams by writing and uploading their stories on One Novel. Here’s how it works:

1. **Write and Upload**: Writers can submit their stories of any genre with a minimum word length of 30,000 words.
2. **Review and Acceptance**: Our dedicated One Novel team reviews each submission to ensure it meets our quality standards.
3. **Rewards**: Upon acceptance, writers can earn rewards of up to 5,000 per story.

#### Financial Success through Our MLM Scheme

At One Novel, we believe in rewarding not just the creators but also those who help expand our community. We’ve implemented a Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) scheme that allows users to earn commissions and vouchers as they progress through various levels.

**Here’s how it works:**

1. **Initial Purchase**: To join the MLM programme, a user must purchase a book from One Novel for 5,000.
2. **Direct Sales**: The user then needs to make 5 direct sales. For each sale, the user earns a 20% commission (1,000).
3. **Downline Sales**:
   - **Level 1**: When the direct recruits make their sales, the original user earns an additional 20% commission on each of their sales.
   - **Level 2**: This process continues with each level generating commissions from the sales made by the downline, up to Level 4.

**Example of Earnings:**

- **Level 1 (Direct Sales)**: 5 sales \* 1,000 = 5,000
- **Level 2**: 25 sales \* 1,000 = 25,000
- **Level 3**: 125 sales \* 1,000 = 125,000
- **Level 4**: 625 sales \* 1,000 = 625,000

**Total Earnings for the Original User**: 780,000 by the time they reach Level 4.

#### Vouchers for Level Completion

In addition to commissions, users earn vouchers as they progress through the levels:

- **Level 1 Completion**: 5 vouchers \* 500 each = 2,500
- **Level 2 Completion**: 25 vouchers \* 500 each = 12,500
- **Level 3 Completion**: 125 vouchers \* 500 each = 62,500
- **Level 4 Completion**: 625 vouchers \* 500 each = 312,500

These vouchers can be used towards future purchases on One Novel, further incentivizing users to continue participating and growing within our community.

#### Our Commitment

At One Novel, we are committed to fostering a supportive and rewarding environment for writers and readers alike. By participating in our Writer Benefit Programme and MLM scheme, users can achieve financial success and gain recognition for their literary talents.
